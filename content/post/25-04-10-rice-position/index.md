The Oceans and Cryosphere Group at Rice University investigates how ice sheets, and oceans interact to shape our planetâ€™s coastlines. Our research focuses on imaging the hidden landscapes at the grounding lines of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, where glacier ice meets the ocean and drives both local and global change. We develop and deploy advanced radar systems and autonomous vehicles to image subglacial topography, measure vertical ice deformation, and monitor basal melt within ice-shelf cavities. By combining these observations with process-based ice-flow and ocean models, we study how internal ice properties, ocean heat content, and atmospheric forcing contribute to variability in melt rates, glacier discharge, and sea-level rise. Our group also explores how ice-sheet-driven sea-level changes intersect with societal vulnerability along coastlines, including in the U.S. Gulf Coast, where we apply terrestrial radar interferometry to monitor infrastructure, coastal erosion, and groundwater systems. Through interdisciplinary collaborations that span engineering, marine science, and climate modeling, we aim to build the tools and knowledge necessary to understand and adapt to coastal change in both polar and populated regions.

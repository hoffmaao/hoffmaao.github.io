abstract: Abstract Subglacial lakes require a thawed bed either now or in the past;
  thus, their presence and stability have implications for current and past basal
  conditions, ice dynamics, and climate. Here, we present the most extensive geophysical
  exploration to date of a subglacial lake near the geographic South Pole, including
  radar-imaged stratigraphy, surface velocities, and englacial vertical velocities.
  We use a 1.5-dimensional temperature model, optimized with our geophysical data
  set and nearby temperature measurements, to estimate past basal-melt rates. The
  ice geometry, reflected bed-echo power, surface and vertical velocities, and temperature
  model indicate that the ice-bed interface is regionally thawed, contradicting prior
  studies. Together with an earlier active-source seismic study, which showed a 32-m
  deep lake underlain by 150 m of sediment, our results suggest that the lake has
  been thermodynamically stable through at least the last 120,000 years and possibly
  much longer, making it a promising prospective site for sediment coring.

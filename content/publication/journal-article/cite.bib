abstract = {Abstract Swath radar technology enables three-dimensional mapping of modern glacier beds over large areas at resolutions that are higher than those typically used in ice-flow models. These data may enable new understanding of processes at the ice-bed interface. Here, we use two densely surveyed swath-mapped topographies (<50 m2 resolution) of Thwaites Glacier to investigate the sensitivity of inferred basal friction proxies to bed roughness magnitude and orientation. Our work suggests that along-flow roughness influences inferred friction more than transverse-flow roughness, which agrees with analytic form-drag sliding theory. Using our model results, we calculate the slip length (the ratio of internal shear to basal slip). We find excellent agreement between the numerically derived slip lengths and slip lengths predicted by analytic form-drag sliding theory, which suggests that unresolved short wavelength bed roughness may control sliding in the Thwaites interior.},

abstract = {Abstract Subglacial lakes require a thawed bed either now or in the past; thus, their presence and stability have implications for current and past basal conditions, ice dynamics, and climate. Here, we present the most extensive geophysical exploration to date of a subglacial lake near the geographic South Pole, including radar-imaged stratigraphy, surface velocities, and englacial vertical velocities. We use a 1.5-dimensional temperature model, optimized with our geophysical data set and nearby temperature measurements, to estimate past basal-melt rates. The ice geometry, reflected bed-echo power, surface and vertical velocities, and temperature model indicate that the ice-bed interface is regionally thawed, contradicting prior studies. Together with an earlier active-source seismic study, which showed a 32-m deep lake underlain by 150 m of sediment, our results suggest that the lake has been thermodynamically stable through at least the last 120,000 years and possibly much longer, making it a promising prospective site for sediment coring.},

abstract={Geology and bed topography influence how ice sheets respond to climate change. Despite the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's capacity to retreat and advance quickly over its over-deepened interior, little is known about the subglacial landscape of the East Antarctic elevated interior that probably seeded West Antarctic ice streams and glaciers. At Hercules Dome, we use three-dimensional swath radar technology to image the upstream origin of large subglacial basins that drain ice from the Antarctic interior into West Antarctic ice streams. Radar imaging reveals an ancient, alpine landscape with hanging tributary valleys and large U-shaped valleys. On the valley floors, we image subglacial landforms that are typically associated with temperate basal conditions and fast ice flow. Formation mechanisms for these subglacial landforms are fundamentally inconsistent with the currently slowly flowing ice. Regional aerogravity shows that these valleys feed into larger subglacial basins that host thick sediment columns. Past tectonism probably created these basins and promoted ice flow from Hercules Dome into the Ross and Filchner--Ronne sectors. This suggests that the landscape at Hercules Dome was shaped by fast-flowing ice in the past when the area may have served as or been proximal to a nucleation centre for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.},

abstract={We present Bedmap3, the latest suite of gridded products describing surface elevation, ice-thickness and the seafloor and subglacial bed elevation of the Antarctic south of 60{\thinspace}{\textdegree}S. Bedmap3 incorporates and adds to all post-1950s datasets previously used for Bedmap2, including 84 new aero-geophysical surveys by 15 data providers, an additional 52 million data points and 1.9 million line-kilometres of measurement. These efforts have filled notable gaps including in major mountain ranges and the deep interior of East Antarctica, along West Antarctic coastlines and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Our new Bedmap3/RINGS grounding line similarly consolidates multiple recent mappings into a single, spatially coherent feature. Combined with updated maps of surface topography, ice shelf thickness, rock outcrops and bathymetry, Bedmap3 reveals in much greater detail the subglacial landscape and distribution of Antarctica's ice, providing new opportunities to interpret continental-scale landscape evolution and to model the past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets.},

abstract = {Abstract Hercules Dome is a prospective ice-core site due to its setting in the bottleneck between East and West Antarctica. If ice from the last interglacial period has been preserved there, it could provide critical insight into the history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The likelihood of a continuous, well-resolved, easily interpretable climate record preserved in ice extracted from Hercules Dome depends in part on the persistence of ice-flow dynamics at the divide. Significant changes in ice drawdown on either side of the divide, toward the Ross or Ronne ice shelves, could change the relative thickness of layers and the deposition environment represented in the core. Here, we use radar sounding to survey the ice flow at Hercules Dome. Repeated radar acquisitions show that vertical velocities are consistent with expectations for an ice divide with a frozen bed. Polarimetric radar acquisitions capture the ice-crystal orientation fabric (COF) which develops as ice strains, so it depends on both the pattern of ice flow and the time over which flow has been consistent. We model the timescales for COF evolution, finding that the summit of Hercules Dome has been dynamically stable in its current configuration, at least over the last five thousand years, a time period during which the Antarctic ice sheet was undergoing significant retreat at its margins. The evident stability may result from a prominent bedrock ridge under the divide, which had not been previously surveyed and has therefore not been represented in the bed geometry of coarsely resolved ice-sheet models.},

pages={178-192},
abstract={Antarctic atmospheric rivers (ARs) are a form of extreme weather that transport heat and moisture from the Southern Hemisphere subtropics and/or mid-latitudes to the Antarctic continent. Present-day AR events generally have a positive influence on the Antarctic ice-sheet mass balance by producing heavy snowfall, yet they also cause melt of sea ice and coastal ice sheet areas, as well as ice shelf destabilization. In this Review, we explore the atmospheric dynamics and impacts of Antarctic ARs over their life cycle to better understand their net contributions to ice-sheet mass balance. ARs occur in high-amplitude pressure couplets, and those strong enough to reach the Antarctic are often formed within Rossby waves initiated by tropical convection. Antarctic ARs are rare events ({\textasciitilde}3 days per year per location) but have been responsible for 50--70{\%} of extreme snowfall events in East Antarctica since the 1980s. However, they can also trigger extensive surface melting events, such as the final ice shelf collapse of Larsen A in 1995 and Larsen B in 2002. Climate change will likely cause stronger ARs as anthropogenic warming increases atmospheric water vapour. Future research must determine how these climate change impacts will alter the relationship among Antarctic ARs, net ice-sheet mass balance and future sea-level rise.},

abstract: Abstract Swath radar technology enables three-dimensional mapping of modern
  glacier beds over large areas at resolutions that are higher than those typically
  used in ice-flow models. These data may enable new understanding of processes at
  the ice-bed interface. Here, we use two densely surveyed swath-mapped topographies
  (<50 m2 resolution) of Thwaites Glacier to investigate the sensitivity of inferred
  basal friction proxies to bed roughness magnitude and orientation. Our work suggests
  that along-flow roughness influences inferred friction more than transverse-flow
  roughness, which agrees with analytic form-drag sliding theory. Using our model
  results, we calculate the slip length (the ratio of internal shear to basal slip).
  We find excellent agreement between the numerically derived slip lengths and slip
  lengths predicted by analytic form-drag sliding theory, which suggests that unresolved
  short wavelength bed roughness may control sliding in the Thwaites interior.

abstract: Abstract Hercules Dome is a prospective ice-core site due to its setting
  in the bottleneck between East and West Antarctica. If ice from the last interglacial
  period has been preserved there, it could provide critical insight into the history
  of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The likelihood of a continuous, well-resolved,
  easily interpretable climate record preserved in ice extracted from Hercules Dome
  depends in part on the persistence of ice-flow dynamics at the divide. Significant
  changes in ice drawdown on either side of the divide, toward the Ross or Ronne ice
  shelves, could change the relative thickness of layers and the deposition environment
  represented in the core. Here, we use radar sounding to survey the ice flow at Hercules
  Dome. Repeated radar acquisitions show that vertical velocities are consistent with
  expectations for an ice divide with a frozen bed. Polarimetric radar acquisitions
  capture the ice-crystal orientation fabric (COF) which develops as ice strains,
  so it depends on both the pattern of ice flow and the time over which flow has been
  consistent. We model the timescales for COF evolution, finding that the summit of
  Hercules Dome has been dynamically stable in its current configuration, at least
  over the last five thousand years, a time period during which the Antarctic ice
  sheet was undergoing significant retreat at its margins. The evident stability may
  result from a prominent bedrock ridge under the divide, which had not been previously
  surveyed and has therefore not been represented in the bed geometry of coarsely
  resolved ice-sheet models.
